# Piccolo

Piccolo is a small, lightweight, high-pitched scripting language (eventually) intended
for embedding in Rust projects.

## Notes

Users should be able to implement `Object` for their own types, so they can be
traced and garbage-collected. We could do this a number of ways:

1. ~~Continue using the mark-and-sweep implementation from
   https://github.com/Darksecond/lox with its unsoundness issues (see
   `runtime::memory::test::use_after_free` in previous commits)~~
2. ~~Just use `Rc<RefCell<dyn Object>>`~~
3. **Heap is a `SlotMap` of `Box<dyn Object>`**

Small issue - We want objects to be able to mutate themselves, so the heap must
be able to give out mutable references to its objects. But the objects'
mutation potentially requires heap manipulation, however, we cannot allow
mutable references to the heap to exist at the same time as mutable references
to the object.

1. We could use a channel (`std::sync::mpsc::channel`) and have the `Object`s
   submit change requests to the `Heap` which will only carry them out when
   there can no longer be any `Box<dyn Objects>` in free space.
2. Do `unsafe` funny business to get around the problem with the limitation
   that only way to get a reference to an `Object` is if the heap still exists,
   or to `take` it from the heap entirely. This could be spicy since we'd have
   to uphold the safety invariants of `SlotMap` and potentially guarantee
   implementors of `Object` would also do so.

## Todo

- Type system? Would be fun
  - Parametric/subtype polymorphism
  - Dynamic dispatch, monomorphization
  - Algebraic data types and pattern matching
  - Type inference
- Compiler

  - https://lib.rs/crates/inkwell
